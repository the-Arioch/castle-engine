This directory contains tools distributed with _Castle Game Engine_ for your comfort,
but not developed within CGE.

Right now this includes:

- astcenc*, compressor for ASTC
- FPC (latest stable version tested with CGE, for some platforms)

In the future:

- astcenc* will be removed
- We will add AMD Compressonator, as more feature-rich
- We will add a Pascal IDE, like VS Code or Lazarus, preconfigured to work with CGE perfectly.
