Once again I shamelessly used freeware loops from
  http://www.flashkit.com/loops/
Usually I don't like advertising sites that are so closely
related with the two diseases of the Internet (advertisements and
Flash), but in this case, my eternal thanks go to this site
and, first of all, to contributors of the loops and sounds
on the site. It's amazing, being able to find so many good
loops / sounds completely free to use.
