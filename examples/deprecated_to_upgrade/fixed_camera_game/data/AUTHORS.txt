nany textures named lemog_xxx

("xxx" in the filename is actual texture name on lemog).

--------------------
Editing:

The "corroded" versions were done by GIMP
"Script-Fu -> Ornaments -> Old photography" trick,
with border = 0 width (I didn't like border effect in this case).

The corroded version of wild_road also used
"Script-Fu -> Ornaments -> Coffe stains" effect
(with accidentaly nicely positioned stain).

The corroded version of human_beach was first (before oldphotography)
processed by "Filters -> Glass effects -> Glass tiles" effect
(on "photo" layer).
