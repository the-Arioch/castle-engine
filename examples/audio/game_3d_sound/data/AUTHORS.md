Data (models and sounds) authors:

- Sounds from [A1 Free Sound Effects](http://www.a1freesoundeffects.com/).

- Rat and tree 3D models are modified (using Blender) files from [3dcafe](http://www.3dcafe.com).

- Rest done by Michalis Kamburelis.

Tools:

- Sky in `skies/` done using [Terragen](http://www.planetside.co.uk/).

- Textures done with [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org) and (for `user_help` and `mute_label_scroll`) a little [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) processing.

- `base_shadowed.png` generated using `gen_light_map` (not maintained anymore - it was an old tool in CGE to bake to texture; baking using Blender is simpler now).

- Rest of 3D modeling in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
